## About our project "CleanOut"

The idea behind it is to help communities to clean the neighborhood by letting users to report trash by uploading (geotagged) image   location. Each report has a status (trash cleaned or not). User can create an event to gather volunteers to help to clean. For Covid-19, AI will ensure uploaded images are about trash & it will detect if there's any trash are related to Covid-19 like masks which need precaution when cleaning or reporting to local authorities.
