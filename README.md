## About our project "CleanOut"

CleanOut is an app built to help communities clean their neighborhood by letting users report trash by uploading (geotagged) image location.
Each report has a status (trash cleaned or not). Users can create an event to gather volunteers to help during the cleaning process. For Covid-19, AI will check if the uploaded images contain any Covid-19 trash like masks that needs precaution measures to clean. Or the user can choose to report to local authorities instead.
